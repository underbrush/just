# just
An extremely idiosyncratic python program for creating music in just intonation.
The user interface, keybindings, things of this nature are all really bad, but "it works for my purposes." 
Someday I'll rewrite everything here to be 1000,0,00,0 times better but today is not that day.

Uses Ben Johnston's notation for just intonation:
```
4 : 5 : 6       4 : 5 : 6
F : A : C : E : G : B : D
        4 : 5 : 6

-------- accidentals ------
# = 25 : 24   | b = 24 : 25
+ = 81 : 80   | - = 80 : 81
7 = 35 : 36   | L = 36 : 35
^ = 33 : 32   | v = 32 : 33
13 = 65 : 64  | t = 64 : 65
---------------------------

```
